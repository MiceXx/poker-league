        The founding principle of the Canadian Poker League was to provide players the opportunity to LEARN, PLAY and IMPROVE their understanding of the mechanics of the game of tournament poker.

        <p>
        Over the years, we have developed a program that provides members the opportunity to learn some of the more intricate aspects of the game, and how to apply them at the tournament table.  The program is now available to all Canadian tournament poker players for FREE.
